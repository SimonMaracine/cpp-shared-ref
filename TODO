- API and behavior as close as shared_ptr's one
- performance (speed and memory) comparable to shared_ptr
- support for polymorphism
- support for deleter
- allocator-aware
- support for shared from this
- support for casts

- profile shared_ref and shared_ptr and compare the performance
- use valgrind to see allocations
- see generated code for both
